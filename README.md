**Operating Systems Concepts with Practical Examples**

This repository contains practical examples demonstrating key concepts of Operating Systems. Each example is implemented in C++ and designed to help understand fundamental OS topics through code.

### **Topics Covered:**
- **Conditional Variables:** Synchronizing threads using conditions to wait and signal.
- **Binary Semaphores:** Managing access to shared resources with mutual exclusion.
- **Multithreading:** Creating and managing threads for concurrent execution.
- **Thread Synchronization:** Avoiding race conditions with mutexes and locks.
- **Producer-Consumer Problem:** Real-world synchronization scenarios.
- **Threaded Summation and Min Value:** Efficient parallel processing with semaphores.

Each example includes clear code and output, making it ideal for learning or revision purposes. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
